# PicoRuby development environment configuration file
# Each environment is immutable, uniquely identified by commit hash + timestamp
#
# Copy this file to `.picoruby-env.yml` and customize for your project:
#   cp .picoruby-env.yml.example .picoruby-env.yml
#
# Usage:
#   pap env show              - Display current environment
#   pap env set ENV_NAME      - Switch to specified environment
#   pap env latest            - Fetch latest versions and switch to them
#   pap cache fetch ENV_NAME  - Fetch environment from GitHub
