## 🚀 Core: Major Refactoring - picotorokko (ptrk)

**Status**: Test Infrastructure First, Then Implementation

**Full Specification**: [docs/PICOTOROKKO_REFACTORING_SPEC.md](docs/PICOTOROKKO_REFACTORING_SPEC.md)

**Overview**:
- Gem name: `pra` → `picotorokko`
- Command: `pra` → `ptrk`
- Commands: 8 → 4 (env, device, mrbgem, rubocop)
- Directory: Consolidate into `ptrk_env/` (replaces `.cache/`, `build/`, `.picoruby-env.yml`)
- Env names: User-defined (no "current" symlink), defaults to `development`
- Breaking changes: Yes (but no users affected - unreleased gem)
- Estimated effort: 3-4 weeks, 7 phases (Test Infrastructure prioritized)

**Key Design Decisions**:
- ✅ Two distinct project roots: Gem development vs. ptrk user
- ✅ Environment name validation: `/^[a-z0-9_-]+$/`
- ✅ No implicit state (no `current` symlink)
- ✅ Tests use `Dir.mktmpdir` to keep gem root clean
- ✅ All quality gates must pass: Tests + RuboCop + Coverage
- ✅ **TDD-First approach**: Test infrastructure before any feature implementation

### Phase 0: Test Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED (1 day - ahead of schedule!)

**Objective**: Establish solid test foundation for all downstream phases. Each task = Red → Green → RuboCop -A → Refactor → Commit.

**Strategy**: Fix infrastructure issues early so Phase 2-6 can focus on feature TDD without blocked tests.

**Completion Summary**:

- ✅ Phase 0.2: SimpleCov exit code verification
- ✅ Phase 0.3: RuboCop integration verification
- ✅ Phase 0.4: Three-gate quality check (Tests 100%, RuboCop 0 violations, Coverage 85.24% line)
- ✅ Phase 0.5: Device command Thor analysis (Infrastructure marker documented)
- **Quality Metrics**: 144 tests, 323 assertions, 100% pass rate
- **Git Status**: Clean, 5 focused commits

- [x] **REFACTOR**: Code is clean and simple ✅
- [x] **COMMIT**: "test: add SimpleCov exit code verification test" (a5343a0) ✅

#### 0.3: Verify RuboCop integration with tests ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **RED**: Test RuboCop integration
  - Test: `bundle exec rubocop` succeeds with 0 violations ✅
- [x] **GREEN**: RuboCop integration verified
  - RuboCop: 0 violations across all files ✅
- [x] **RUBOCOP**: Check current state ✅
- [x] **REFACTOR**: N/A (RuboCop is the refactor tool) ✅
- [x] **COMMIT**: "test: add RuboCop integration verification test" (575d4ff) ✅

#### 0.4: Three-gate quality check (Tests + RuboCop + Coverage) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **RED**: Write integration test for three-gate quality
  - Test file: `test/quality_gates_test.rb` ✅
- [x] **GREEN**: All three gates verified passing
  - Tests: 144/144 (100%) ✅
  - RuboCop: 0 violations ✅
  - Coverage: 85.24% line, 65.2% branch ✅
- [x] **RUBOCOP**: `bundle exec rubocop -A` ✅
- [x] **REFACTOR**: N/A ✅
- [x] **COMMIT**: "test: add three-gate quality verification test" (c5a0785) ✅

#### 0.5: Device command Thor argument handling investigation
- [x] **ANALYSIS**: Understand Thor issue without fixing yet
  - Read: `test/commands/device_test.rb` (currently excluded from Rakefile)
  - Understand: Why Thor treats env names as subcommands
  - Record: Exact error behavior, root cause

**ANALYSIS RESULT (Phase 0.5 Completed)**:

**Problem**: 複数のテストが `return # Skipped: test-env argument breaks SimpleCov exit code detection` で skip されている

**Root Cause - Thor Subcommand Interpretation**:
```ruby
# Test attempts to call:
Pra::Commands::Device.start(['flash', 'test-env'])

# But Thor interprets 'test-env' as a SUBCOMMAND, not an argument
# Thor looks for a 'test-env' subcommand in the Device class
# When not found: raises SystemExit(1) with "Could not find command test-env"
# This leaves $ERROR_INFO set globally, corrupting SimpleCov exit code detection
```

**Affected Tests** (test/commands/device_test.rb):
- Line 46-50: "raises error when build environment not found"
- Line 78-82: "shows message when flashing"
- Line 147-151: "shows message when monitoring"
- Line 198-202: "shows message when building"
- Line 250-253: "shows message when setting up ESP32"
- Line 347-352: "delegates custom_task to R2P2-ESP32 rake task"
- Line 407-412: "uses default env_name when not provided"

**Current Workaround**: Tests call `return` early to avoid SystemExit

**Solution** (Deferred to Phase 5):
- Refactor device command to use explicit `--env` flag
- Change: `Device.start(['flash', 'test-env'])` → `Device.start(['flash', '--env', 'test-env'])`
- This prevents Thor from interpreting env_name as a subcommand

- [x] **MARK**: [TODO-INFRASTRUCTURE-DEVICE-COMMAND]
  - **Status**: Documented for Phase 5 (device command refactor to `--env` flag)
  - **Reference**:
    - Test file: `test/commands/device_test.rb` (lines 46-50, 78-82, 147-151, 198-202, 250-253, 347-352, 407-412)
    - Implementation: `lib/ptrk/commands/device.rb` (requires `--env` option refactor)
    - Configuration: Rakefile currently excludes device_test.rb from test suite
  - **Not blocking**: Phase 2-4 proceed with other commands; device is Phase 5 focus
  - **Dependency**: Phase 5.1 must fix this before re-enabling device_test.rb

### Phase 4: Directory Structure - TDD Approach (3-4 days)

**⚠️ CRITICAL POLICY: No Backward Compatibility Required**
- This is an **unreleased gem** (version 0.x) with **zero users**
- Breaking changes are **fully acceptable** and **encouraged** for cleaner design

## 🔮 Post-Refactoring Enhancements

### AST-Based Template Engine ✅ APPROVED

**Status**: Approved for Implementation (Execute AFTER picotorokko refactoring)

**Full Specification**: [docs/PICOTOROKKO_REFACTORING_SPEC.md#template-strategy-ast-based-template-engine](docs/PICOTOROKKO_REFACTORING_SPEC.md#template-strategy-ast-based-template-engine)

**Overview**: Replace ERB-based template generation with AST-based approach (Parse → Modify → Dump)

**Key Decisions**:
- ✅ Ruby templates: Placeholder Constants (e.g., `TEMPLATE_CLASS_NAME`)
- ✅ YAML templates: Special placeholder keys (e.g., `__PTRK_TEMPLATE_*__`), comments NOT preserved
- ✅ C templates: String replacement (e.g., `TEMPLATE_C_PREFIX`)
- ✅ ERB removal: Complete migration, no hybrid period
- ✅ **Critical requirement**: All templates MUST be valid code before substitution

**Key Components**:
- `Ptrk::Template::Engine` - Unified template interface
- `RubyTemplateEngine` - Prism-based (Visitor pattern for ConstantReadNode)
- `YamlTemplateEngine` - Psych-based (recursive placeholder replacement)
- `CTemplateEngine` - String gsub-based (simple identifier substitution)

**Migration Phases**:
1. PoC (2-3 days): ONE template + validation
2. Complete Rollout (3-5 days): ALL templates converted
3. ERB Removal (1 day): Delete .erb files

**Web Search Required** (before implementation):
- Prism unparse/format capabilities
- Prism location offset API verification
- RuboCop autocorrect patterns for learning

**Estimated Effort**: 8-12 days

**Priority**: High (approved, post-picotorokko)

### Future Enhancements (Phase 5+)

## 🔬 Code Quality: Test Coverage Improvement (Low Priority)

**Current Status**: Phase 4.1完了時点
- Line Coverage: 80.61% (474 / 588)
- Branch Coverage: 57.98% (109 / 188)
- CI Threshold: line 75%, branch 55% ✅ (達成)

**Target Goals** (低優先度):
- Line Coverage: **85%** (目標 +4.4%, 約26行)
- Branch Coverage: **65%** (目標 +7%, 約13分岐)

**未カバー領域の特定** (Phase 4.1時点):
1. **lib/pra/env.rb** (64.81% → 要改善)
   - `get_timestamp`: Git timestamp取得（テスト環境でgitコミット作成が不安定）
   - `traverse_submodules_and_validate`: 3段階サブモジュールトラバース
   - `get_commit_hash`: コミット情報から hash形式生成（未使用の可能性）
   - `clone_with_submodules`: サブモジュール初期化エラーハンドリング

2. **lib/pra/commands/device.rb** (55.48% → Phase 5で対応予定)
   - device_test.rbが除外されているため（Thor引数処理問題）
   - Phase 5.1で`--env`フラグリファクタリング後にテスト再有効化

**実装アプローチ** (TDD cycle):
1. **RED**: 未カバー箇所のテストを作成
   - Git操作のモック化改善（`get_timestamp`, `traverse_submodules_and_validate`）
   - エラーケースの網羅（`clone_with_submodules`失敗シナリオ）
   - 条件分岐の全パターンテスト（branch coverage向上）

2. **GREEN**: 既存実装を変更せずテストをパス
   - テスト環境でのgit操作安定化
   - スタブ/モックの適切な設計

3. **RUBOCOP**: `bundle exec rubocop -A`

4. **COMMIT**: "test: improve coverage to 85%/65%"

**優先順位**: **低** (Phase 6以降、他の機能実装が完了後)

**見積もり**: 1-2日

**備考**:
- device.rbのカバレッジはPhase 5.1で自然に向上する
- 現在の75%/55%基準で品質は十分保証されている
- 85%/65%は理想的な目標値であり、必須要件ではない
